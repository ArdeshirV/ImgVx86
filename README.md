[ImgVx86.com](https://github.com/ArdeshirV/ImgVx86/releases/download/1/ImgVx86.zip) demonstrates photo in DOS operating system</h2>

## Description
[ImgVx86.com](https://github.com/ArdeshirV/ImgVx86/releases/download/1/ImgVx86.zip) is an executable COM file that is only 385 bytes and is written in Assembly programming language. It can display a unique type of non-standard photo in the DOS operating system. I developed this assembly program around 1998 when I was about 13 years old, and I haven't made any changes to it since 2003, except for adding copyright and a free GPL license because I want to share it here.
