          <h2>ImgVx86 demonstrates photo in DOS operating system</h2>
          <p>The ImgVx86.com is an executable COM file that is only 385 byte and it is written in Assembly programming language but it can show a kind of none standard photo in DOS operating system. I developed this assembly program about 1998 when I was about 13 years and I didn't change it since 2003 except about adding copyright and GPL license because I want to share it here.</p>
