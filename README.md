<h3>ImgVx86 show photo in DOS operating system</h3>
<p>The ImgVx86.com is an executable COM file that is only 385 byte and it is written in Assembly programming language but it can show a kind of none standard photo in DOS operating system. I developed this assembly program about 1998 when I was about 13 years and I didn't change it since 2003 except about adding copyright and GPL license to share it here.</p>
